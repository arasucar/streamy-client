# Getting Started with Create React App

This client project has been craeted to simulate a small streaming service like Twitch etc. To work appropriately, this project needs a json server and a RTMP server runnig in the same machine. You can find a basic version of both servers in my repositories.

- Installation and Server Startup
    -clone the repo
    - run `npm install --save`
    - run `npm start`
